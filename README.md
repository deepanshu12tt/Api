Here i have made an API using Python's FastAPI Framework, uvicorn  which allow us to run ASGI Application and Pydantic.
i have firstly instatiate the Fastapi and made a database i.e db and then by using get method i have allow to fetch single trade and filter trades.
in fetch.py i have made a class trade which is derived from BaseModel from Pydantic.
